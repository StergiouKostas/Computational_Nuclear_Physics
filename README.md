# Computational Nuclear Physics

This repository contains computational projects for a *Nuclear Physics* course. Each project focuses on a different problem, implemented in Python (or other tools).  

## Projects  
1. **Deuteron in a Spherical Potential Well**: Solving the Schrödinger equation for a deuteron in a finite potential well.  
2. **Neutron Star Outer Crust Composition**: Modeling the equilibrium composition of a neutron star’s outer crust.  
3. **Radioactive Decay Dynamics**: Simulating the time evolution of decaying nuclei.  
4. **Electron Scattering Form Factors**: Extracting nuclear radius (*R*) and surface thickness (*a*) from scattering data.  

See each subfolder for detailed explanations and code.
